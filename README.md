# Moody Cloud

* Moody Cloud is an application program that allows a user to track their mood, the weather, and journal about their day. 


## Description

* Moody Cloud was designed for users to explore and document their own relationship between the weather, their mood and general well-being. 

* By being able to track their day-to-day symptoms and journal how they are feeling overall, the user will be able to recognize patterns and learn more about the influences that the weather has on their mood. 


## Future Features

* Future features we would like to include in our application include the following:

    * Allow the user to upload their own photos and attach them to the journal entry.
    * Be able to store the weather for that day and the users mood (clicking on mood icons instead of buttons), and attach that information to the journal entry.
    * The user would be able to use a calendar to view previous days journal entries, weather, photos, etc. 
    * A "memories" feature that alerts the user with a notification for their entry on that day one year ago.
